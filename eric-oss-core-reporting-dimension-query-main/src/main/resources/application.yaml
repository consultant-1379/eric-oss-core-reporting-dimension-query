# Observability configuration adds URI tags to client requests for http_client_requests_* metrics
# 2 options available
# complete: add-query enabled -> URI with path and query (uri="/path?key=value")
# partial:  add-query disabled -> URI with path only (uri="/path") (DEFAULT)
# When Observability client configuration is disabled (observability.client.enabled=false), then URI path tag in the metric becomes "none". (uri="none")
#
# NOTE: Marking metrics with complete url path option might lead to performance issues when observing metrics data since this option will create a new metric entry based on the query options.
# It might have cardinality explosion issues based on the given complexity of client request urls, especially with complex queries. (Each variable in request queries will generate a new metric entry.)
