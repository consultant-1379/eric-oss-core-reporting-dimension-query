  # VA
  #
  - security-master-gerrit-reviewer: "umang.a.patel@ericsson.com"  # Update as needed. Gerrit review group containing PSM and/or Security Masters that should be auto-invited to commits that has a positive or negative verdict from va-test point of view. Used by service-va-test.
  - va-arm-dev-repo: "proj-bos-assurance-va-dev-generic-local"  # Arm repo where va artifacts will be stored for later use, such as for generating aggregated va-report, service level va-report, diff comparison in presubmit va-test, vulnerability diff in PRI.
  - va-path-to-vulnerability-report-config: "cicd/config/va/report_config.yaml"  # Update as needed. Full path to the Vulnerability Report config file as described in https://gerrit-gamma.gic.ericsson.se/plugins/gitiles/adp-cicd/bob-adp-release-auto/+/master/vulnerability_analysis_2.0/. Config should keep base information about product, included images, SPOC and already performed analysis and mitigations/exemptions. Used by service-va-report and service-va-test.
  - va-test-wiki-containerization-vulnerability-impact: "https://eteamspace.internal.ericsson.com/display/BSSDO/Vulnerability-Analysis+via+service-va-test"  # Update as needed. Wiki link to include in gerrit messages detailing Vulnerability-Analysis-Test verdicts detailing the process the organization should use. Appointed PSM should decide and document process to follow. See sample wikis from consumer point of view "https://eteamspace.internal.ericsson.com/display/TPGCHA/Containerization+Vulnerability+Impact" ,"https://rmca.bss.seli.gic.ericsson.se/wiki/index.php/Vulnerability_Analysis". Used by service-va-test.
  - vulnerability-config-auto-updated-with-tools-versions: "True"  # Valid values are True and False. Used by service-va-report, service-va-test, service-pre-release, integration-hf-va-test, integration-hf-pre-release
  - service-va-report-check-if-semver-released-strategy: "manual"  # Update as needed. Possible values are "helm" and "manual". If helm is selected, then the semver is extracted from CHART_VERSION and a check is done towards settings.helm-project-release}/settings.helm-chart-name/settings.helm-chart-name-var.service-va-report-helm-chart-semver+" to see if it is released or not. If manual is selected, then consumer needs to populate .bob/var.service-va-report-helm-artifact-semver-released based on own logic before service-va-report generate-finalize-va-report is invoked. (might be expanded in the future, docker might be one future option). Used by service-va-report.
  - service-va-report-fetch-va-and-str-from-va-hub-datalake: "True"  # Update as needed. Possible values are "True" and "False". Should only be set to True if datalake integration is in place and if PSM wants the job to fetch the Vulnerability Report and Security Test Report from datalake in verify-va-report. Used by service-va-report.
  - va-report-ciscat-harden-image: "True"  # Update as needed. Possible values are "True" and "False". Indicates whether the hardening script will be applied on the custom built image which ciscat will be executed on. Used by service-va-report.
  - va-report-exit-on-evaluate-resultcodes: "False"  # Update as needed. Possible values are "True" and "False". Most consumers configure False to let Security Release Verification Pipeline not be halted by temporary glitches and issues and failed scans and instead let it run to completion where data is collected in verify-pre-release whereupon Release Decision can be taken based on all available information. Indicates whether exit var.highest-resultcode-xxx should be executed. Used by integration-hf-va-report, service-va-report, integration-va-report
  - va-report-generate-adp-va-report-for-va-hub: "True"  # Update as needed. Possible values are "True" and "False". Should only be switched to True once the service level product have been registered in datalake and required permissions have been given. See checklist at https://eteamspace.internal.ericsson.com/display/BSSDO/VA+Hub+integration. Used by service-va-report
  - va-report-generate-experimental-va-report: "True"  # Update as needed. Possible values are "True" and "False". Will use the experimental template in batteries/template/va_report_template_local.md. This attempts to follow latest template https://gerrit-gamma.gic.ericsson.se/plugins/gitiles/adp-cicd/bob-adp-release-auto/+/master/vulnerability_analysis_2.0/templates/fetch_report.md.template but with local adaptations such as checksum, dockerbenchscore, appendix and some formatting improvements. Feedback from PSMs are welcome. Used by service-va-report
  - va-report-run-ciscat-scan: "True"  # Update as needed. Possible values are "True" and "False". Indicate whether ciscat scan should be executed. Used by service-va-report ## Section VA
  - va-report-upload-to: "datalake"  # Possible value is only "datalake". In the past "va-hub" and "all" were allowed as well but these being deprecated in favor of only supporting datalake. Indicates where to upload the va-report and data to. Related to va-report-generate-adp-va-report-for-va-hub (for service-va-report). For pre-release, actual opt-in via rule invocation required.  Used by integration-hf-pre-release, service-va-report (generate_aggregated_va_report.sh)
  - va-xrayscan-docker-drop-project: "proj-bos-assurance-drop-docker-global"  # Update as needed. Other possible naming schemes are docker-v2-global-proj-todo-xray-local and docker-v2-global-proj-todo-drop-xray-local. Used to populate var.va-report-xrayscan-docker-project-in-use in case var.va-report-helm-chart-version does not contain a "+". The var.va-report-helm-chart-version is used for both triggering re-scan as well as fetching xray results using fetch-xray command. Used by service-va-report
