  title: Core Analytics Reporting Dimensioning Query (CARDQ) Service
  description: |
    This REST-API is designed to be used by the Assurance Augmentation Service (AAS) to augment 
    topology information to performance metrics (PM) data related to core network functions (NF)
    for core slice key performance indicators (KPIs). This API enables us to recognize the list of 
    NSI, NSSI, Geographic Site, and PLMN Id info related to the core NF.

        This operation returns a list of dimensioning query types supported by
        this ARDQ instance, which allows a client to discover the augmentation
        query types available from this server. This, in turn, allows a client
        to validate augmentation configuration provided to the Assurance
        Augmentation Service (AAS) and allows the AAS to reject augmentation
        configuration targeting an unsupported dimensioning query type.
